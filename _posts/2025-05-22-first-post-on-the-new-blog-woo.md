Welcome to my blog! I am planning to start writing regular updates on side
projects i've been working on; mostly to stop annoying friends and family
directly and allow them to read up on what i've been up to... but i'll probably
still continue. Sorry, not sorry?

Right now a huge focus of my learning is going into 3D rendering, so Iâ€™ll be
writing a lot about that I imagine, and boy is there a lot I can write about:
Data oriented design, linear algebra, video game engine design, et cetera, et
cetera.

There is no real goal to this blog except to have fun and hopefully learn
something along the way.

Stick around, you might just find out something new (or not, I make no
promises).

As a side note, if anyone told me configuring Jekyll was so bloody hard, I
would've chosen something else. Ruby is truly awful.
