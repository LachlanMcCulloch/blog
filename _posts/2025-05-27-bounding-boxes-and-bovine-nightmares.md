Okay, so now i‚Äôm in the deep end of learning. The proverbial safety bumpers have
been removed. I completed [Learn WGPU][learn-wgpu] and now I have to do
something myself?!

So I decided to start out simple: load in a new model. Seemed easy enough - find
a free model online and drop it in. One ‚Äúfree obj‚Äù Google search later, and I
have found a nice bull model. Loads of vertices and polygons. Boom. Done.

**Problem #1** enter stage left. I naively swap out `‚Äúcube.obj‚Äù` for
`‚Äúbull.obj‚Äù` and hit `cargo run`. Crash. Instantly.

Ok, wtf. Why didn‚Äôt that work? Time to read the compiler error‚Ä¶ of course - an
‚Äúindex out of bounds‚Äù error. Classic.

To spare you the boring details, I eventually figured it out. The new model file
has no materials. So I hacked them in.

```rust
if materials.is_empty() {
    let dummy_texture = texture::Texture::from_image(
        device,
        queue,
        &image::DynamicImage::ImageRgba8(image::RgbaImage::from_pixel(
            1,
            1,
            image::Rgba([255, 255, 255, 255]),
        )),
        Some("white"),
    )
    .expect("Failed to create placeholder texture");
    materials.push(model::Material::new(
        device,
        "white",
        dummy_texture.clone(),
        dummy_texture,
        layout,
    ));
}
```

Now we can expect a nice sheen on the models - with absolutely whacked lighting,
since the normal map (the second dummy_texture used in the model::Material::new)
is completely inappropriate here.

## I have become Bull, destroyer of cows

We fire up the program, and what emerges is pure nightmare fuel: an unholy
fusion of limbs and bovine flesh, a monstrous cow deity born of code and chaos.

Turns out the bull model is massive compared to the original cub. Like, not even
in the same ballpark. Thus began my journey into understanding üåà model scaling
üåà.

## Wait, how does 3D rendering even work again?

3D rendering uses a bunch of cool linear algebra to make 3D images appear on a
2D screen.

What most people don‚Äôt realise is that it‚Äôs all smoke and mirrors: you‚Äôre
looking at a flat 2D projection of a 3D scene. With matrix math, we take 3D
coordinates and transform them onto your screen. Do this meany times a second
and suddenly - smooth animation that tricks your brain into thinking it‚Äôs real.

When we load a model, its coordinates are in what‚Äôs called _object space_. To
render it in our scene, we transform it into _world space_. Along the way we can
rotate, translate and **scale it.**

So how do we shrink our massive bull?

Enter: **the bounding box**.

A bounding box is just the smallest box that fits entirely around an object. We
can use it to figure out how _big_ the bull is, then scale it down to match our
cube model in size.

Bounding boxes are useful for more than just scaling though - they‚Äôre used in
basic collision detection - though I haven‚Äôt really touched that yet. Right now,
I just want to _not_ enact a demonic ritual each time I load my program.

Here‚Äôs the code I used to calculate a bounding box from an array of vertex
positions:

```rust
fn calculate_bounding_box(vertex_positions: Vec<[f32; 3]>) -> ([f32; 3], [f32; 3]) {
    let mut min = [f32::INFINITY; 3];
    let mut max = [f32::NEG_INFINITY; 3];
    for position in vertex_positions {
        for i in 0..3 {
            min[i] = min[i].min(position[i]);
            max[i] = max[i].max(position[i]);
        }
    }
    (min, max)
}
```

This function gives us the min and max corners of the bounding box - effectively
the bottom-left and top-right points in object space.

Great! So now what?

## Making scale happen

To scale the bull down, I measured each bounding box‚Äôs size and found their
largest side. Then, I created a scaling factor: cube size divided by bull size.

```rust
impl BoundingBox {
    pub fn new(bounding_box: ([f32; 3], [f32; 3])) -> Self {
        Self {
            min: bounding_box.0,
            max: bounding_box.1,
        }
    }

    pub fn size(&self) -> [f32; 3] {
        [
            self.max[0] - self.min[0],
            self.max[1] - self.min[1],
            self.max[2] - self.min[2],
        ]
    }

    pub fn max_extent(&self) -> f32 {
        self.size()[0].max(self.size()[1]).max(self.size()[2])
    }
}

let scaling_factor = cube_box.max_extent() / bull_box.max_extent()
```

And voila, we have a bona fide scaling factor to rein in those bulls.

## Taming the Beast

Now we have a scaling factor that can be applied to our model matrix passed to
our GPU shader.

For now I‚Äôve jammed the scale into my instance struct, but I‚Äôll probably
refactor this to be more ‚Äúmodel aware‚Äù later.

```rust
pub struct Instance {
    pub position: cgmath::Vector3<f32>,
    pub rotation: cgmath::Quaternion<f32>,
    pub scale_factor: f32, // new scale factor - yay!
}

impl Instance {
    pub fn to_raw(&self) -> InstanceRaw {
        let scale = cgmath::Matrix4::from_scale(self.scale_factor);
        let rotation = cgmath::Matrix4::from(self.rotation);
        let translation = cgmath::Matrix4::from_translation(self.position);
        let model = translation * rotation * scale;
        let normal = cgmath::Matrix3::from(self.rotation).into();
        InstanceRaw {
            model: model.into(),
            normal,
        }
    }
}
```

With scale in place, everything renders correctly.

Without diving too deep into the math weeds, _Fig 1_ shows what this
transformation looks like. Don‚Äôt stress if you don‚Äôt follow it, i‚Äôll probably do
a whole post on transformation matrices soon.

Applying this fix in the shader (sorry this post turned into a bit of a ‚Äúdraw
the rest of the f\*\*\*ing owl‚Äù situation), we finally get something beautiful.
A lovely pasture of grazing bulls.

## Wrapping up

That‚Äôs it for now. I‚Äôve got some serious cleanup ahead since this was a quick
hack job. But hey, I learned how bounding boxes work and I made my bulls less
terrifying.

Stay tuned for more posts where I probably break stuff, glue it back together
and learn something in the process.
